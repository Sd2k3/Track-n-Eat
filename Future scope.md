## The Track'N Eat Project is an initiative to explore low-cost solutions to healthcare problems in the food industry. Usage of colouring chemicals to enhance the appearance of fruits and vegetables has been a huge issue since the past decade and we seek to create a device that can help us identify  the food products that have been subjected to it.

## On successful construction of the device, we would look forward to improving it in ways such as
## 1. Portability  - Without hampering the output, we would like to test the limits of our project's size, and try decreasing the space it would take.
## 2. Efficiency - Keeping our project on a low cost end, we are interested to explore technology that could be used to increase the accuracy of colour detection
